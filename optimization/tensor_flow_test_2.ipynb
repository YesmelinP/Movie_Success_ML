Ultimately, we settled on 70 epochs, as it offered the same performance as 100 epochs but required less computational power.\n","\n","Next, we explored modifications to the number of hidden layers and activation functions. The default activation function was ReLU, which is commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in hidden layers.
