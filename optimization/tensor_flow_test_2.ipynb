This model yielded an accuracy of 68%. To optimize performance, we experimented by adjusting the number of epochs, both increasing and decreasing them.

Ultimately, we settled on 70 epochs, as it offered the same performance as 100 epochs but required less computational power.\n","\n","Next, we explored modifications to the number of hidden layers and activation functions. The default activation function was ReLU, which is commonly used due to its simplicity and effectiveness in hidden layers. I decided to add an additional hidden layer and switch the activation function to tanh, which, unlike ReLU, outputs values between -1 and 1 and is similar to the sigmoid function.
